      - `dedication` (text)
      - `intro` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `chapters`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `book_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `chapter_number` (integer)
      - `title` (text)
      - `lede` (text)
      - `chapter_image` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `pages`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
